# DS-Search-Algorithms ðŸš€
- Project resolving the classic "Farmer, Wolf, Goat, Cabbage Problem" using graph traversal and search methods such as:
    - Breadth-First-Search (BFS).
    - Depth-First-Search (DFS).
    - Depth-Limited Search (DLS).
    - Iterative Deepening Search (IDS).
    - Uniform-Cost Search (UCS).
    - A* Search.
    - Greedy Algorithm.
